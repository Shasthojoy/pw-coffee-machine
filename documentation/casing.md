Build a tiny 'prod ready' case for the circuit and the Intel Edison
-----

This document explains how you can put the huge and unconvenient breaboard and wires into an handy case you just have to connect to your coffee maker.

## Material

The components are the same as ones described  [here](./hardware.md).

**In addition, you will need :**

* A plastic **enclosure** (at least 7x5x3 cm). [This one](http://uk.farnell.com/multicomp/g3107/enclosure-abs-grey-ip65-120x80x55mm/dp/1526653), for instance.
* A **drill** (to peforate the enclosure). If you haven't got a drill, it should work with a peaked screwdriver.
* A **stripboard**, on which we will solder the components. [This one on)](http://uk.farnell.com/multicomp/n254-899/stripboard-sngl-sided-0-1inch/dp/9423230) will be perfect.
* A **soldering iron**.

## Step 1 : Build the PCB

## Step 2 : Perforate the enclosure

## Step 3 : Wire the relay, the PCB and the Edisons

## Step 4 : Connect the case to the cofee maker
